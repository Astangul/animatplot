Animatplot is build on top of three main classes:

* Animation
* Block
* Timeline

A ``Timeline`` holds the information and logic to actually control the timing of all animations.

A ``Block`` represent any "thing" that is to be animated.

An ``Animation`` is a composition of a list of blocks and a timeline. This class builds the final animation.
